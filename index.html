            Hey, Listen! My name is Mark Cortez. I'm in my final semester here at Sacramento State University, California. 
            I'm currently taking Senior Project along with several other courses. I hope to pursue a full-time software engineering
            position after receiving my B.Sc. in Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy activities such as exercising, reading, 
            watching movies, hiking, and photography.
